## Outline

- R is a calculator

- five commands to look at objects

- extracting pieces

- a first glimpse at data

---
## The R language

- Learning a new language: grammar, vocabulary

- Loading, examining, summarizing data

- Creating data

- Getting help

- Miscellaneous useful stuff

## Grammar

- Basic algebra is the same as calculator/mathematics

- explicit operators: `2*x` not `2x`,  `2^p` instead of `2p`

- Applying a function is similar 

- Making and saving a variable, use `<-` or `=`

- Everything in R is a vector

---
## Examples

.pull-left[
**Math** 

##### Assignments $x = \frac{2}{3}$

##### Functions $\sqrt{x}$

##### Vectors $y = \left( 1, 2, 3, 5\right)^t$  

##### Indices $y_1$ 

##### Mathematical Operators $\sum_{i=1}^{4} y$

##### $2y$

]
.pull-right[
**Code**

#### `x <- 2/3`

#### `sqrt(x)`

#### `y <- c(1,2,3,5)`

#### `y[1]`

#### `sum(y)`

#### `2*y`

]

## Your Turn (5 min) 


- Introduce vector $x$ defined as $x = (4, 1, 3, 9)^t$

- Introduce vector $y$ defined as  $y = (1, 2, 3, 5)^t$
- Calculate the Euclidean distance between the two vectors $x$ and $y$, defined as $$d = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^4 (x_i - y_i)^2}$$



---
## Vocabulary 

- What verbs (=functions) do you need to know?

- Loading data

- Accessing parts of things

- Statistical summaries

- ...

---
## R Reference Card

- Download the R Reference Card from http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf

- Open/Print it so that you can glance at it while working


---
## Very basics

#### Getting help within R

If you want to know what a specific `command` is doing:

```
?command
help(command) 
help.search(command)
```

#### Getting out

```
q()
```
Quits out of the console

---
## Loading class data

- Some R packages have in-built datasets

- For this class, there is an R package available on github 

- Installing/Updating `classdata` package (once every so often):

```{r}
devtools::install_github("haleyjeppson/classdata")
```

- Make the data available (every time you start R):

```{r}
library(classdata)
```

---
class: inverse
## Your Turn (5 min)

Install the package `classdata` on your machine  


Make the package active in your current R session:

```
library(classdata)
```

Check the R help on the dataset `fbi`<br>

What happens if you just type in the name of the dataset?

---
## Inspecting objects

for object `x`, we can try out the following commands:

- `x`

- `head(x)`

- `summary(x)`

- `str(x)`

- `dim(x)`

<br/>

Try these commands out for yourself on the `fbi` data.  

---
## The fbi data

- `fbi` is a data frame with columns (variables) and rows (records)

```{r}
str(fbi)
```

---
## Extracting parts of objects

For object `x`, we can extract parts in the following manner:

```
x$variable
x[, "variable"]
x[rows, columns]
x[1:5, 2:3]
x[c(1,5,6), c("State","Year")]
x$variable[rows]
```
`rows` and `columns` are vectors of indices.

<br/>

Try these commands out for yourself on the `fbi` data.

---
## Statistical summaries

Elements of the five point summary: 

`mean, median, min, max, quartiles`

<br/>

Other summary statistics:

`range, sd, var`

<br/>

Summaries of two variables:

`cor, cov`  

---
class: inverse
## Your turn

- Look at the first 10 data records of the `fbi` data

- Compute mean and standard deviation for the number of counts. Why do you get NAs? (read `?NA`)

- Advanced:  Read `?mean` and `?sd`, and fix missing value problem

---
class:inverse
## Your turn - practice to ask questions

Write down questions that you could answer with this data 4 minutes by yourself, then pair up for another 3 minutes, and we'll write ideas on the board
