## Questions for the fbi data

---
## Plan for answers

1. Explore how one (or more) variables are distributed: 
  - barchart or histogram

2. Explore how two variables are related:  
  - scatterplot, boxplot, tile plot

3. Explore how two variables are related, conditioned on other variables:  
  - facetting, color & other aesthetics

---
## Different version of the data

We will use a different shape of the `fbi` data - a wide form:

```{r}
library(classdata)
str(fbiwide)
```

---
## Scatterplots

- need two continuous variables

- we'll be using the `ggplot2` framework for plotting

# Why `ggplot2`?

## Why `ggplot2`

- Wildly popular package for statistical graphics: over 2.5 million downloads from CRAN in 2017 (several thousand times per day)

- Developed by Hadley Wickham (An ISU Alumni)

- Designed to adhere to good graphical practices (uses the grammar graphics)

- Constructs plots using the concept of layers

- Supports a wide variety plot types and extensions

- http://ggplot2.org/book/ or Hadley's book *ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis* for reference

## Grammar of graphics

- Developed by Leland Wilkinson

- Think about graphical forms rather than a limited set of graphs

- Different types of graphs may appear completely distinct, but share many common elements.

- By making different visual choices, you can use graphs to highlight different aspects of the same data.

For example, here are three ways of displaying the same data:

```{r plots-3, echo = FALSE, fig.align='bottom', fig.height=5, fig.width=15}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
p1 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut, fill=cut)) + geom_bar() + labs(title = "Bar Chart", subtitle = "Cartesian coordinates") + scale_fill_viridis_d(begin = .1, end = .9)
p2 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(factor(1), fill=cut)) + geom_bar(width=1) + labs(x="", title = "Fill-Bar", subtitle = "Cartesian coordinates") + scale_fill_viridis_d(begin = .1, end = .9)
p3 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(factor(1), fill=cut)) + geom_bar(width=1) + coord_polar(theta= "y") + labs(x="", title = "Fill-Bar", subtitle = "Polar coordinates") + scale_fill_viridis_d(begin = .1, end = .9)

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 3, nrow = 1)
```


???

- Charts are instances of much more general objects

- An abstraction which makes thinking, reasoning, and communicating graphics easier

## ggplot2: A layered grammar of graphics

A graphical representation (plot) consists of:

1. **default data and mappings** (`aes`):  data variables are mapped to visual properties of the graphical elements

2. **one or more layers**:  
  - geometric element (`geom`, such as point, line, rectangle, text, ...), 
  - statistical transformation (`stat`, such as identity, counts, bins, ...), 
  - position adjustment,  
  - (optional) one dataset and set of aesthetic mappings

3. **scales**: map values in the data space to values in an aesthetic space 

4. **coordinate system** (`coord`): normally Cartesian, but could use polar coordinates for pie charts or different mapping coordinates

5. **facetting**: for small multiples (subsets) and their arrangement

6. **theme**: fine-tune display items, such as font and its size, color of background, margins, ...

---
## Scatterplots in `ggplot2`

- `aes` allows us to specify mappings

- scatterplots need a mapping for `x` and a mapping for `y`:

<br/>

```
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = Burglary, y = Murder)) +
  geom_point()
```  

```
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Murder))) +
  geom_point()
```  

```
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Motor.vehicle.theft))) +
  geom_point()
```

## Revision - Interpreting Scatterplots

- Big patterns

  - Form and direction

  - Strength

- Small patterns

- Deviations from the pattern

  - Outliers
    
---
<br/><br/>
 
#### **Form**

Is the plot linear?  Is the plot curved?  Is there a distinct pattern in the plot? Are there multiple groups?

#### **Strength**

Does the plot follow the form very closely?  Or is there a lot of variation?   

#### **Direction**

Is the pattern increasing?  Is the plot decreasing?

- **Positively**: Above (below) average in one variable tends to be associated with above (below) average in another variable.

- **Negatively**: Opposite pattern.

## Aesthetics

Can map other variables to size or colour
<br/>

```
ggplot(aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Motor.vehicle.theft),
           colour=State), data=fbiwide) + geom_point()

ggplot(aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Motor.vehicle.theft),
           colour=Year), data=fbiwide) + geom_point()
```

```
ggplot(aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Motor.vehicle.theft),
           size=Population), data=fbiwide) + geom_point()
```

<br/>

# Make your first figure

---

## We begin with the data

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = fbiwide)
```

---

## Then we specify the aesthetic mappings

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=10, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = Burglary, y = Murder))
```

???
or what relationships we want to see
---

## Then we choose a geom

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = Burglary, y = Murder)) +
    geom_point()
```

---

## We can add additional aesthetics

```{r, eval=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = Burglary, y = Murder)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = State)) 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = Burglary, y = Murder)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = State)) + theme(legend.position = "none")
```

???
we could add another layer
---
## Mapping aesthetics vs setting aesthetics

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = Burglary, y = Murder)) +
    geom_point(color = "orange", alpha = .4) 
```

---
## Transform coordinates

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = Burglary, y = Murder)) +
    geom_point(color = "orange", alpha = .4) +
    scale_x_log10() + 
    scale_y_log10()
```
