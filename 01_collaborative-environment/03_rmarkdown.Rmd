## R is ...

- **Free** to use

- **Extensible**: Over 15,000 user contributed add-on packages currently on CRAN!

- **Powerful**: With the right tools, get more work done, faster.

- **Flexible**: Not a question of *can*, but *how*.

- **Frustrating**: Flexibility comes at a cost (easy to shoot yourself in the foot!).

```{r eval = FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("metacran/crandb")
pkgs <- crandb::list_packages(limit = 999999)
length(pkgs)
```

## RStudio is ... 

RStudio is a convenient interface for R  
  - an IDE, integreated development environment

At its simplest:  

- R is like a car’s engine  

- RStudio is like a car’s dashboard

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/engine-dashboard.png")
```

## The RStudio IDE

1. **Source editor:** Docking station for multiple files, Useful shortcuts ("Knit"), Highlighting/Tab-completion, Code-checking (R, HTML, JS), Debugging features  

2. **Console window:** Highlighting/Tab-completion, Search recent commands

3. **Environment pane:** Tools for package development, git, etc

4. **Other tabs/panes:** Graphics, R documentation, File system navigation/access

**LPT**: save yourself the headaches figuring out file paths and instead work in an RStudio R project (popup menu at the top left)

## Markdown

- Markdown is a particular type of **markup** language.

- Markup languages are designed to **produce documents from plain text**.

- Some of you may be familiar with **LaTeX**. This is another (less human friendly) markup language for creating pdf documents.

- LaTeX gives you much greater control, but it is restricted to pdf and has a much greater learning curve.

- **Markdown** is becoming a **standard**. Many websites will generate HTML from Markdown (e.g. GitHub, Stack Overflow, reddit, ...).

## Markdown is easy

```
*italic*
**bold**

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- List item 1
- List item 2
    - item 2a
    - item 2b

1. Numbered list item 1
1. Numbered list item 2
    - item 2a
    - item 2b
```

## What is RMarkdown?

- ... an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R. 

- combines markdown syntax with embedded R code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document.

- creates fully reproducible reports - each time you knit the analysis is ran from the beginning

???
  - Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

## Why R Markdown?


- **It's simple.** Focus on writing, rather than <br>debugging silly errors.

- **It's flexible.** Markdown was created to <br>simplify writing HTML, but thanks to <br>pandoc, Markdown converts to many <br>different formats!

- **It's dynamic.** Find a critical error? Get a <br>new dataset? Regenerate your report without copy/paste hell!

- **Encourages transparency.** Collaborators (including your future self) will thank you for integrating your analysis & report.

- **Enables interactivity/reactivity.** Allow your audience to explore the analysis (rather than passively read it).

3. Navigate to the RMarkdown cheat sheet and download a copy (Google for the link!)

4. Make changes to the markdown formatting and knit again.

5. Export output to different files.

6. If you feel adventurous, change some of the R code and knit again.
