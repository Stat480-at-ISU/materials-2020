## R is ...

- **Free** to use

- **Extensible**: Over 15,000 user contributed add-on packages currently on CRAN!

- **Powerful**: With the right tools, get more work done, faster.

- **Flexible**: Not a question of *can*, but *how*.

- **Frustrating**: Flexibility comes at a cost (easy to shoot yourself in the foot!).

```{r eval = FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("metacran/crandb")
pkgs <- crandb::list_packages(limit = 999999)

## RStudio is ... 

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

[From Julie Lowndes](http://jules32.github.io/resources/RStudio_intro/):  

> If R were an airplane, RStudio would be the airport, providing many, many supporting services that make it easier for you, the pilot, to take off and go to awesome places. <br><br> Sure, you can fly an airplane without an airport, but having those runways and supporting infrastructure is a game-changer.

## Markdown

- Markdown is a particular type of **markup** language.

- Markup languages are designed to **produce documents from plain text**.

- Some of you may be familiar with **LaTeX**. This is another (less human friendly) markup language for creating pdf documents.

- LaTeX gives you much greater control, but it is restricted to pdf and has a much greater learning curve.

- **Markdown** is becoming a **standard**. Many websites will generate HTML from Markdown (e.g. GitHub, Stack Overflow, reddit, ...).

## Markdown is easy

```
*italic*
**bold**

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- List item 1
- List item 2
    - item 2a
    - item 2b

1. Numbered list item 1
1. Numbered list item 2
    - item 2a
    - item 2b
```

## What is RMarkdown?

- ... an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R. 

- it combines the core syntax of markdown with embedded R code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document.

- R Markdown documents are fully reproducible (they are automatically regenerated whenever underlying R code or data changes).

## Why R Markdown?

- **It's simple.** Focus on writing, rather than debugging silly errors.

- **It's flexible.** Markdown was created to simplify writing HTML, but thanks to pandoc, Markdown converts to many different formats!

- **It's dynamic.** Find a critical error? Get a new dataset? Regenerate your report without copy/paste hell!

- **Encourages transparency.** Collaborators (including your future self) will thank you for integrating your analysis & report.

- **Enables interactivity/reactivity.** Allow your audience to explore the analysis (rather than passively read it).

## Your Turn (5 min)


1. Open RStudio, create a new project.

2. Create a new RMarkdown file and knit it.

3. Navigate to the RMarkdown cheat sheet and download a copy (Google for the link!)

4. Make changes to the markdown formatting and knit again.

5. Export output to different files.

6. If you feel adventurous, change some of the R code and knit again.
