## Factors

- A special type of variable to indicate categories

- Includes both the **labels** and their **order** (i.e. numbers) 

- By default, text variables are stored in factors during input

- Numeric categorical variables have to be converted to factors manually

- `factor` creates a new factor with specified labels

- Inspect the `fbi` object. How many variables are there? Which type does each of the variables have?

- Make a summary of Year

- Make Year  a factor variable: `fbi$Year <- factor(fbi$Year)`  

- Compare summary of Year to the previous result  

- Are there other variables that should be factors (or vice versa)?

## `r emo_warn` factors in boxplots `r emo_warn`

boxplots in ggplot2 only work properly if the x variable is a character variable or a factor:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(classdata)
```

```{r}
twoyear <- dplyr::filter(fbi, Year %in% c(1961, 2014))
```

.pull-left[
```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height = 3, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = twoyear, 
       aes(x = Year, y = Count)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height = 3, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = twoyear, 
       aes(x = factor(Year), y = Count)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
]

## Data types: checking and casting

Checking for, and casting between types: 

- `str` or `mode` provide info on type


- `is.XXX` (with XXX either `factor, int, numeric, logical, character, ...` ) checks for specific type


- `as.XXX` casts to specific type


---
## Casting between types

![](images/casting.png)

<br/>

`r emo_warn` `as.numeric` applied to a factor retrieves *order* of labels, not labels, even if those could be interpreted as numbers.

To get the labels of a factor as numbers, first cast to character and then to a number.

---
## Levels of factor variables

- `levels(x)` shows us the levels of factor variable `x` in their current order

- factor variables often have to be re-ordered for ease of comparisons

- We can specify the order of the levels by explicitly listing them, see `help(factor)`

- We can make the order of the levels in one variable dependent on the summary statistic of another variable

---
## Reordering factor levels - manual

```{r}
levels(fbi$Type)
```

manually (extremely sensitive to typos):

```{r}
levels(factor(fbi$Type, levels=c("Larceny.theft", "Burglary", "Motor.vehicle.theft", "Aggravated.assault", "Robbery", "Legacy.rape", "Murder.and.nonnegligent.Manslaughter", "Rape")))
```

---
## Reordering factor levels - <br>using another variable

`reorder(factor, numbers, function)`

reorder levels in factor by values in `numbers`. Use `function` to summarise (average is used by default). 

```{r}
levels(reorder(fbi$Type, fbi$Count, na.rm=TRUE))
```

missing values in `numbers`? make sure to use parameter `na.rm=TRUE`!

class: yourturn
.center[
# Your turn 
]

For this your turn use the `fbi` object from the `classdata` package. 

- Introduce a rate of the number of reported offenses by population into the `fbi` data. You could use the *Ames standard* to make values comparable to a city of the size of Ames (population ~70,000).

- Plot boxplots of crime rates by different types of crime. How can you make axis text legible? 

- Reorder the boxplots of crime rates, such that the boxplots are ordered by their medians. 

- For one type of crime (subset!) plot boxplots of rates by state, reorder boxplots by median crime rates

---
## Changing Levels' names

```{r}
levels(fbi$Type)
```

```{r}
levels(fbi$Type)[6] <- "Murder"

levels(fbi$Type)
```
