## Factors

- A special type of variable to indicate categories

- Includes both the **labels** and their **order** (i.e. numbers) 

- By default, text variables are stored in factors during input

- Numeric categorical variables have to be converted to factors manually

- `factor()` creates a new factor with specified labels

???
categorical variable = variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values

# Your Turn

Load a sample of data from the [General Social Survey](http://gss.norc.org/) with the following code: `data(gss_cat, package = "forcats")`

Inspect the `gss_cat` object. 

How many variables are there? 

Which type does each of the variables have?

Make a summary of `year`.

Make `year` a factor variable: `gss_cat$year <- factor(gss_cat$year)`  

Compare summary of `year` to the previous result.

Are there other variables that should be factors (or vice versa)?

## `r emo_warn` factors in boxplots `r emo_warn`

boxplots in ggplot2 only work properly if the x variable is a character variable or a factor:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
twoyear <- dplyr::filter(gss_cat, year %in% c(2000, 2014))
```

.pull-left[
```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height = 3, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = twoyear, 
       aes(x = year, y = tvhours)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, fig.width=3, fig.height = 3, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = twoyear, 
       aes(x = factor(year), y = tvhours)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
]

---
## Data types: checking and casting

Checking for, and casting between types: 

- `str` or `mode` provide info on type


- `is.XXX` (with XXX either `factor, int, numeric, logical, character, ...` ) checks for specific type


- `as.XXX` casts to specific type


---
## Casting between types

![](images/casting.png)

<br/>

`r emo_warn` `as.numeric` applied to a factor retrieves *order* of labels, not labels, even if those could be interpreted as numbers.

To get the labels of a factor as numbers, first cast to character and then to a number.


---
## Levels of factor variables

Use `levels(x)` to check the levels of factor variable `x` in their current order 

```{r echo = TRUE}
levels(gss_cat$race)
```

<br/>
Use `summary(x)` to see order of the levels with counts for each level  

```{r echo = TRUE}
summary(gss_cat$race)
```

`dplyr::count()` will also work but more on this next week...

```{r echo = TRUE}
gss_cat %>% count(race)
```


---
## `r emo_warn` factors in bar charts `r emo_warn`

A barchart can also provide us with a quick summary *provided* the <br> levels have values.

.pull-left[
```{r echo = TRUE}
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(race)) +
  geom_bar()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo = TRUE}
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(race)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE)
```
]

## Changing the order

Factor variables often have to be re-ordered for ease of comparisons

- We can manually specify the order of the levels by explicitly <br> listing them, see `help(factor)`

- We can make the order of the levels in one variable dependent on the summary statistic of another variable

  - the `forcats` package (part of the `tidyverse` `r emo_warn` but not automatically loaded!) contains many <br> functions to make this easier and less error-prone

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=9}
gss_cat$relig <- gss_cat$relig %>% forcats::fct_shuffle()
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(x = relig)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip()
```

---
## Reordering factor levels - manual

```{r, echo = TRUE}
levels(gss_cat$relig)
```

manually (**extremely sensitive to typos**):

```{r, echo = TRUE}
levels(factor(gss_cat$relig, levels=c("Moslem/islam", "Hinduism", "Buddhism", "Other eastern", "Jewish", "Christian", "Orthodox-christian", "Catholic", "Protestant", "Inter-nondenominational", "Native american", "Other", "None", "No answer", "Don't know",  "Not applicable")))
```

---
## Reordering factor levels - <br> by frequency

Use the function `fct_infreq()` from the `forcats` packagge to order the categorical variable `relig` by its frequency.

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=9}
library(forcats)
ggplot(gss_cat, aes(x = fct_infreq(relig))) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip()
```

---
## Reordering factor levels - <br>using another variable


Base R option: `reorder(factor, numbers, function)`

reorder levels in factor by values in `numbers`. Use the argument `function` to summarise (average is used by default). 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
levels(reorder(gss_cat$relig, gss_cat$tvhours, na.rm=TRUE))
```

missing values in `numbers`? make sure to use parameter `na.rm=TRUE`!

---
## Reordering factor levels - <br>using another variable

Option using the `forcats` package: `fct_reorder(factor, numbers, function)`

```{r echo=TRUE}
relig_summary <- gss_cat %>% group_by(relig) %>% summarise(age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE), tvhours = mean(tvhours, na.rm = TRUE), n = n())
```

.pull-left[
```{r fig.height=3}
ggplot(relig_summary, aes(x = tvhours, 
      y = relig)) + 
  geom_point()
```
]
  
.pull-right[
```{r fig.height=3}
ggplot(relig_summary, aes(x = tvhours, 
    y = fct_reorder(relig, tvhours))) + 
  geom_point()
```
]

class: yourturn
.center[
# Your turn 
]

For this your turn use the `fbi` object from the `classdata` package. 

- Introduce a rate of the number of reported offenses by population into the `fbi` data. You could use the *Ames standard* to make values comparable to a city of the size of Ames (population ~70,000).

- Plot boxplots of crime rates by different types of crime. How can you make axis text legible? 

- Reorder the boxplots of crime rates, such that the boxplots are ordered by their medians. 

- For one type of crime (subset!) plot boxplots of rates by state, reorder boxplots by median crime rates

---
## Changing Levels' names - <br> using base R


```{r, echo = TRUE}
levels(gss_cat$partyid)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
levels(gss_cat$partyid)[2] <- "Not sure"

levels(gss_cat$partyid)
```

---
## Changing Levels' names - <br> using forcats

The most general and powerful tool is `fct_recode()`

  - can recode, or change, the value of each level
  - levels not mentioned are left as is

```{r, echo = TRUE}
levels(gss_cat$partyid)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
partyid2 = fct_recode(gss_cat$partyid,
    "Republican, strong"    = "Strong republican", "Republican, weak"      = "Not str republican",
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep", "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
    "Democrat, weak"        = "Not str democrat", "Democrat, strong"      = "Strong democrat"
)
levels(partyid2)
```

---
## Lump levels together

If you want to collapse a lot of levels, `fct_collapse()` is a useful variant of `fct_recode()`.  

For each new variable, you can provide a vector of old levels:

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
partyid2 = fct_collapse(gss_cat$partyid,
    other = c("No answer", "Don't know", "Other party"),
    rep = c("Strong republican", "Not str republican"),
    ind = c("Ind,near rep", "Independent", "Ind,near dem"),
    dem = c("Not str democrat", "Strong democrat"))
levels(partyid2)
```

<br/>
You can lump together all the small groups with `fct_lump()`

```{r, echo = TRUE}
relig2 = fct_lump(gss_cat$relig, n = 6)
summary(relig2)
```
