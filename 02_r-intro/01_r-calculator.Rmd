## The R language

- Learning a new language is **hard**!  

  - grammar, vocabulary

- Loading, examining, summarizing data

- Creating data

- Getting help

- Miscellaneous useful stuff
]

---
## Grammar

- Basic algebra is the same as calculator/mathematics

- explicit operators: `2*x` not `2x`,  `2^p` instead of `2p`

- Applying a function is similar 

- Making and saving a variable, use `<-` or `=`

- Everything in R is a vector

---
## Examples

.pull-left[
**Math** 

##### Assignments $x = \frac{2}{3}$

##### Functions $\sqrt{x}$

##### Vectors $y = \left( 1, 2, 3, 5\right)^t$  

##### Indices $y_1$ 

##### Mathematical Operators $\sum_{i=1}^{4} y$

##### $2y$

]
.pull-right[
**Code**

#### `x <- 2/3`

#### `sqrt(x)`

#### `y <- c(1,2,3,5)`

#### `y[1]`

#### `sum(y)`

#### `2*y`

]

- Introduce vector $x$ defined as $x = (4, 1, 3, 9)^t$

- Introduce vector $y$ defined as  $y = (1, 2, 3, 5)^t$
- Calculate the Euclidean distance between the two vectors $x$ and $y$, defined as $$d = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^4 (x_i - y_i)^2}$$



---
## Vocabulary 

- What verbs (=functions) do you need to know?

- Loading data

- Accessing parts of things

- Statistical summaries

- ...

- Open/Print it so that you can glance at it while working

## R essentials

A short list (for now):  

Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parantheses:  

`do_this(to_this)`  
`do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)`  

Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with $:  

`dataframe$var_name`  

Packages are installed with the install.packages function and loaded with the library function, once per session:  

`install.packages("package_name")`  
`library(package_name)`  

---
## Very basics

#### Getting help within R

If you want to know what a specific `command` is doing:

```
?command
help(command) 
help.search(command)
```

#### Getting out

```
q()
```
Quits out of the console

---
## Loading class data

- Some R packages have in-built datasets

- For this class, there is an R package available on github 

- Installing/Updating `classdata` package (once every so often):

```{r}
devtools::install_github("haleyjeppson/classdata")
```

- Make the data available (every time you start R):

```{r}
library(classdata)
```

---
class: yourturn
.center[
# Your Turn (5 min) 
]
Install the package `classdata` on your machine  


Make the package active in your current R session:

```
library(classdata)
```

Check the R help on the dataset `fbi`<br>

What happens if you just type in the name of the dataset?

---
## Alternative method 

... not able to install devtools or the classdata package?

```{r}
fbi <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stat480-at-ISU/materials-2020/master/02_r-intro/data/fbi.csv")
```

---
## Inspecting objects

for object `x`, we can try out the following commands:

- `x`

- `head(x)`

- `summary(x)`

- `str(x)`

- `dim(x)`

<br/>

Try these commands out for yourself on the `fbi` data.  

---
## The fbi data

- `fbi` is a data frame with columns (variables) and rows (records)

```{r}
str(fbi)
```

---
## Extracting parts of objects

For object `x`, we can extract parts in the following manner:

```
x$variable
x[, "variable"]
x[rows, columns]
x[1:5, 2:3]
x[c(1,5,6), c("State","Year")]
x$variable[rows]
```
`rows` and `columns` are vectors of indices.

<br/>

Try these commands out for yourself on the `fbi` data.

---
## Statistical summaries

Elements of the five point summary: 

`mean, median, min, max, quartiles`

<br/>

Other summary statistics:

`range, sd, var`

<br/>

Summaries of two variables:

`cor, cov`  

---
class: yourturn
.center[
# Your Turn
]
- Look at the first 10 data records of the `fbi` data

- Compute mean and standard deviation for the number of counts. Why do you get NAs? (read `?NA`)

- Advanced:  Read `?mean` and `?sd`, and fix missing value problem

Write down questions that you could answer with this data 4 minutes by yourself, then pair up for another 3 minutes, and we'll write ideas on the board
