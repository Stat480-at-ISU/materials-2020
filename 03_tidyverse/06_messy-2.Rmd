# Messy (2): 
## Multiple variables are <br>stored in one column

---
## one col $\rightarrow$ multiple cols  

Use `separate()` to split values wherever a separator character appears

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   `data %>%` <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `separate(combined_var, into = c("var1", "var2"))`

<br>
`separate()` arguments:   

  1. the name of the column to separate  
  
  2. the names of the columns to separate into
  
<br>
Optional `separate()` arguments:  

- `sep` : a specific character to use to separate a column (interpreted as a regular expression) OR a vector of integers (positions to split at)

- `convert = TRUE` : attempt to convert variable types to something more suitable than the existing type.
---


```{r}
df <- data_frame(x = c(NA, "a.1", "a.4", "b.3"))
df 
df %>% separate(x, into = c("A", "B")) 
df %>% separate(x, into = c("A", "B"), sep = "([.])", convert = TRUE)
```

# Your Turn


The Iowa Data Portal is a wealth of information on and about the State of Iowa. The website 
[Campaign Expenditures](https://data.iowa.gov/Government/Campaign-Expenditures/3adi-mht4/data) provides data on campaign expenditures. The code below reads the data into an R session.

```
url <- "https://data.iowa.gov/api/views/3adi-mht4/rows.csv"
campaign <- readr::read_csv(url)
```

Assess the 'messiness' of the data. List issues that prevent us from working with the data directly. Which of these issues are of type (1) or (2) of messiness?

---
## Problems with the data:

No **messy 1**?  
- problems of type **Messy 1** are typically hard to detect and often up to interpretation/dependent on the analysis to be done.

<br>
**messy 2**? 
- `Date` is text, in the format of Month/Day/Year 

- city coordinates are a combination of City name, state, zip code and geographic latitude and longitude. 

<br>
**Other messiness**? 
- expenditure amount is a textual expression, not a number

## Some extra tidying

Use `parse_number()` from the `readr` package to drop any non-numeric characters before or after the first number.  

Other parsers: `col_skip()`, `cols_condense()`, `cols()`, `parse_datetime()`, `parse_factor()`, `parse_guess()`, `parse_logical()`, `parse_vector()`

# Your Turn 

-  Check the help for the function `parse_number()` in the `readr` package and use it on the campaign expenditure data.

- Use `separate()` to split the date variable into year, month and day.

- Use `separate()` again to extract geographic latitude and longitude <br> **Hint**: you might need several steps of `separate()`


---
class: yourturn
# Your Turn - exploration

Use `dplyr` functionality to answer the following questions:

  1. What is the total amount of campaign expenditure?
  
  2. What is the single largest cost in the campaign expenditures?
  
  3. Plot geographic longitude and latitude. Do campaign expenditures stay in the State of IA? Investigate oddities.
