```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = TRUE,
	message = FALSE,
	warning = FALSE
)
```


### Your turn 

Use the `box` data from the package `classdata`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(classdata)
```

#### Are there any missing values in the dataset `box`?

```{r}
summary(box) # there are missing values!
```

#### What are the values of `Rank` when `Rank.Last.Week` is missing?

```{r}
box %>% 
  filter(is.na(Rank.Last.Week)) %>% 
  head()
```


#### What is the dimension of the data set `box`, when removing all missing values with the function `na.omit()`?

```{r}
dim(box)
dim(na.omit(box)) # don't use na.omit
```


#### Why does the following statement fail? `box$Rank.Last.Week <- na.omit(box$Rank.Last.Week)` 

There is a mismatch in the dimensions.
